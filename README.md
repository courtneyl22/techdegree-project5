 Public API Request

Using JavaScript, I created an employee directory by communicating with a third-party API (Application Programming Interface).

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- AJAX

This project includes the following:

API Usage
- 12 random users are pulled from the API
- New random employee information displays each time the page refreshes

User Directory
- The directory displays 12 users from the Random User API, and includes the following for each user:
  1. Employee Image
  2. First and Last Name
  3. Email
  4. City or location
- Employees can be filtered by name with dynamically added search feature.

Modal Window
- Modal window displays at least the following details:
  1. Employee image
  2. Name
  3. Email
  4. City or location
  5. Cell Number
  6. Detailed Address, including street name and number, state or country, and post code.
  7. There is a way to close the modal window.
- Functionality has been added to switch back and forth between employees when the detail modal window is open.
- No errors in the console when the end or beginning of the list is reached.

Structure, Style, & CSS
- The major elements of the directory and modal window are in place and roughly match the mockups.
- Note: Modal window address can have the state's full name, rather than the two letter state code.
- Changes made in CSS:
  1. Font was changed, font color changed
  2. Background color for body & the .card class were changed
  3. Mackground color and font color for the modal window were changed
