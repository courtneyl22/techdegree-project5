 Public API Request

I decided to go for Meets Expectations. My project includes the following:

API Usage
- 12 random users are pulled from the API
- New random employee information displays each time the page refreshes

User Directory
- The directory displays 12 users from the Random User API, and includes the following for each user:
  1. Employee Image
  2. First and Last Name
  3. Email
  4. City or location

Modal Window
- Modal window displays at least the following details:
  1. Employee image
  2. Name
  3. Email
  4. City or location
  5. Cell Number
  6. Detailed Address, including street name and number, state or country, and post code.
  7. There is a way to close the modal window.

Structure, Style, & CSS
- The major elements of the directory and modal window are in place and roughly match the mockups.
- Note: Modal window address can have the state's full name, rather than the two letter state code.
- Changes made in CSS:
  1. Font was changed
  2. Background color for body & the .card class were changed
  3. Mackground color and font color for the modal window were changed
